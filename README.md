# Emyprion Game Notes

Notes for the PC game "Empyrion Galactic Survival"

## Small Vessels (SV)

### Warp Capability

Small vessels can only warp within the same solar system. Trying to warp to another system fails with the message "0.0LY range". Inter-system warp is only possible with a capital vessel (CV).
